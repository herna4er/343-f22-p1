        <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html. Your pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.</li>
        <p>There are 5 html pages. index, news, roster, schedule, and store.</p>
        <li>Each page must declare its favicon (fine and possibly preferred to use the same one for all pages).</li>
        <p>favicon is declared for each page.</p>
        <li>Your site must include some sort of header.</li>
        <p>Same header is used throughout all 5 pages. Also includes a nav bar.</p>
        <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.</li>
        <p>Site has a navbar that contains links to all different pages.</p>
        <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. Use comments to note where you completed this activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. Consider using this to control images or switching blocks between rows (for large screens) and columns (for small).</li>
        <p>I did not explicitly media queries.</p>
        <li>Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, users with images disabled, and webcrawlers.</li>
        <p>There are many images throughout the website and each image has an alt attribute that describes the images.</p>
        <li>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the Nu Validator and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator .</li>
        <p>All pages were ran through the validator and web accessibility evaluator without raising any warnings.</p>
        <li>Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph copy in a serif font.</li>
        <p>I use headers and paragraph elements throughout the site. I be doubly sure I also styled h1 and paragraph elements to use different font families in the common_style.css file.</p>
        <li>Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, but it must be present and it must use built-in content verification. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.</li>
        <p>There is a form at the bottom of the index.html page that is meant to serve as a sign up sheet for the site.</p>
        <li>Your site must include links to external sites.</li>
        <p>There are links in the store page to go to sites where someone is able to purchase a jersey or game tickets.</p>
        <li>Your site must be available at https://<yourusername or your partner's username>.github.io/343-f22-p1</li>
        <p>By the time that a submission for project 1 is due, the site will be available at my github account.</p>
        <li>In https://<yourusername or your partner's username>.github.io/343-f22-p1/report.html, write a brief report containing an itemized breakdown of how you believe you have met the expectations listed above, and linking to the PDF of your design sketch.</li>
        <p>This is the report.html page that breaks down how I met the requirements and <a href="./design_sketch.pdf">this is the link to the pdf</a>.</p>
